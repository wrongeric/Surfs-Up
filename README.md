# Surfs Up

Surfs Up is an app that allows surfers to access the local surf conditions at any local beach. 

The project began as a 48 hour Hackathon but evolved into a fully functional and mobile responsive app after the initial application was completed.  The requirements were fairly straightforward, create a game or application that combined external data sources via AJAX calls.

### Features

* AJAX calls to three separate API's

* Fully mobile responsive Layout and Design

* User Authentication and Login via Passport and MYSQL Database
